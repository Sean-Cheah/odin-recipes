        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This classic grilled cheese sandwich recipe calls for just white bread, sliced cheese, and butter. It's easy to switch up the bread and cheese to suit your taste preferences and, if you like, you can substitute mayonnaise for butter.</p>

            <li>White Bread</li>
            <li>Sliced Cheese</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            Steps
            <li>Butter the bread on one side and place the bread butter-side down on a hot skillet.</li>
            <li>Top with cheese, then place another slice of bread on top (butter-side up).</li>
            <li>Cook until the bottom slice is lightly browned, then flip.</li>
            <li>Continue cooking until the cheese is melted.</li>
        </ol>
